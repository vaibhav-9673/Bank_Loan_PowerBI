# Bank Loan Analysis Power BI Project

Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Power BI Project!
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to uncover key lending insights, borrower behavior, risk indicators, and performance trends using Microsoft Power BI.

### Objective
1. The primary goal of this project is to:
2. Monitor loan portfolio performance
3. Evaluate borrower risk and repayment behavior
4. Support data-driven lending decisions
5. Improve operational efficiency and risk management

### Dashboard 1: Summary
#### 🔑 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
<br>**1. Total Loan Applications:** Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
<br>**2. Total Funded Amount:** Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.
<br>**3. Total Amount Received:** Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
<br>**4. Average Interest Rate:** Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.
<br>**5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

### 🧠 Key Insights Derived
1. Certain states dominate loan applications and disbursements
2. Higher DTI often correlates with increased loan risk
3. Employment length strongly influences loan approval
4. Specific loan purposes show higher repayment reliability

### 🧩 Tools & Technologies
1. Microsoft Power BI
2. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
3. Data Modeling
4. Data Cleaning & Transformation
5. Interactive Visual Analytics

### 📌 Recommendations Based on the Analysis
Based on insights derived from the Summary, Overview, and Details dashboards, the following recommendations can help improve lending performance, risk management, and operational efficiency:

**1️⃣ Strengthen Risk Assessment for High DTI Borrowers**
Loans with higher Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios show increased risk.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Apply stricter approval criteria or higher interest margins for high-DTI borrowers.
2. Introduce automated DTI-based risk scoring during loan approval.

**2️⃣ Optimize Lending Strategy by Region**
Certain states contribute significantly more to loan applications and funded amounts.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Focus marketing and sales efforts in high-performing regions.
2. Re-evaluate lending policies in underperforming regions to improve penetration or reduce exposure.

**3️⃣ Prioritize Low-Risk Loan Purposes**
Some loan purposes demonstrate better repayment behavior and lower default risk.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Offer preferential interest rates or faster approvals for low-risk purposes.
2. Limit exposure or tighten checks for high-risk loan purposes.

**4️⃣ Adjust Interest Rates Based on Borrower Profile**
Interest rate trends vary across grades, employment length, and credit profiles.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Implement risk-based pricing models.
2. Reward stable borrowers (longer employment length, verified income) with competitive rates.

**5️⃣ Improve Loan Portfolio Balance**
Loan term analysis highlights concentration in specific tenure lengths.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Diversify loan terms to reduce portfolio risk.
2. Promote optimal loan tenures aligned with borrower repayment capacity.

**6️⃣ Enhance Verification & Compliance Processes**
Verified borrowers generally show stronger repayment behavior.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Encourage income and identity verification through incentives.
2. Make verification mandatory for high-value loans.

**7️⃣ Leverage Monthly Trend Insights for Planning**
Seasonal patterns are visible in monthly loan applications and disbursements.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Align staffing, marketing, and capital allocation with high-demand periods.
2. Introduce targeted campaigns during low-activity months.

**8️⃣ Improve Monitoring of Loan Status**
Loan status segmentation provides early warning signals.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Actively monitor loans transitioning toward delinquency.
2. Introduce proactive borrower engagement and early recovery strategies.

**9️⃣ Automate Decision-Making Using Analytics**
Manual analysis can be time-consuming and inconsistent.
<br>**Recommendation:**
1. Integrate dashboards with automated alerts for risk thresholds.
2. Use analytics-driven insights to support faster credit decisions.

### 🔍 Overall Business Impact
1. Implementing these recommendations can:
2. Reduce loan defaults
3. Improve portfolio profitability
4. Enhance customer targeting
5. Strengthen risk governance
6. Support sustainable lending growth

### 🏁 Conclusion
The Bank Loan Analysis Power BI Project successfully demonstrates how data visualization and analytics can transform raw loan data into actionable business insights. Through the Summary, Overview, and Details dashboards, the project provides a holistic view of loan performance, borrower behavior, regional trends, and risk indicators.
Key metrics such as loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios enable effective monitoring of portfolio health. Interactive visualizations allow stakeholders to quickly identify high-performing regions, assess borrower risk profiles, detect seasonal trends, and track loan status distributions.
Overall, this project highlights the power of Power BI, DAX, and data modeling in supporting data-driven lending decisions, improving operational efficiency, mitigating credit risk, and optimizing loan strategies. It serves as a strong real-world analytics use case and a portfolio-ready project showcasing business intelligence and financial data analysis skills.
